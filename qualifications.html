          <h3>Explanation</h3>
          <p>
            Although I have experience with frontend development, I've decided
            to focus my career on backend development and Applied AI. Honestly,
            I chose this path because I found it to be the most fun field to
            learn, and it has such an exciting future ahead. There's something
            really compelling about building intelligent systems that can
            actually solve real problems, and I love the challenge of working
            with complex backend architectures. My interest in Applied AI goes
            beyond just learning. I've been hands-on with it across different
            projects. I've worked on everything from machine learning algorithms
            for the eBay ML Challenge to building AI-powered crop recommendation
            tools at hackathons. Right now, I'm co-founding TAKEOFFX, a startup
            that's bringing AI to the construction industry. We're building an
            app that speeds up takeoff creation for construction firms, helping
            them generate bids from blueprints way faster and more accurately.
            It's been an incredible experience combining my technical background
            with entrepreneurship and seeing firsthand how AI can shake up
            traditional industries that haven't really been touched by modern
            technology yet. Through my internships, I've gotten solid experience
            in both backend systems and AI implementation. At General Motors
            Financial, I worked on optimizing API performance with Redis
            caching, which cut response times by 45%, and set up Docker
            containers to improve scalability and reduce setup time. At Ipelint,
            I got to work on production-level AI systems, designing algorithms
            with Google BERT and Hugging Face models that could predict
            trademark conflicts with 87% accuracy. I also built data pipelines
            to handle 3.5 million trademarks using MongoDB and S3, which taught
            me a lot about working with large-scale data. I'm currently working
            toward dual degrees in Computer Science and Statistics at Texas A&M,
            which gives me a strong foundation in both the engineering and
            mathematical sides of AI. I'm proficient in Java, Python, C/C++,
            Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, and AI frameworks like PyTorch. I've also
            picked up leadership experience as Team Lead at Aggie Create, where
            I coordinated project timelines and presentations. My goal is to
            keep exploring what's possible with Applied AI and build solutions
            that actually make a difference for businesses while continuing to
            learn and grow in this field.
